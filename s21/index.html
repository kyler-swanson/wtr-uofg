                    <u>Introduction</u>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From May 2021 to December 2021, I had the opportunity to
                    work at <a href="https://tulip.com">Tulip</a> remotely.
                    Specifically, I worked on the
                    <a
                        href="https://www.tulip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GroceryEcomm-4.pdf"
                        >Tulip Grocery</a
                    >
                    and <a href="https://well.ca">Well.ca</a> team. Throughout
                    these 8 months, I learned a lot about high-traffic,
                    large-scale code and infrastructure. I developed many large
                    and complex features during my time there. This includes the
                    French localization of
                    <a href="https://well.ca/fr">Well.ca</a>, new Well.ca
                    Multiplex Gift Wrap flow, loyalty partner integration
                    (DataCandy), CMS system overhaul, and much more. I was also
                    able to physically visit the Well.ca fulfillment and
                    distribution centre in Guelph.

                    <u>About Tulip</u>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tulip is now a company of many products and solutions
                    targeting international fashion giants. A small list of
                    their clients include Chanel, Tory Burch, Boggi Milano,
                    Missoni, Mulberry, and more. Based in Kitchener, Ontario and
                    now WFH-first, it is expanding rapidly and growing it's pool
                    of talent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At a high-level, Tulip is a SaaS company. They provide a
                    custom POS and clienteling solution to such fashion
                    companies on a subscription-based monetization model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of Tulip's lesser known products is their e-commerce and
                    Grocery platform. The largest client on the e-commerce
                    platform is Well.ca. Well.ca is a retailer based in Guelph
                    that sells health, beauty, baby, home, and green and natural
                    products. The majority of my work was on Well.ca.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Tulip Grocery platform is the newer version of the
                    monolithic e-commerce platform that runs Well.ca. The
                    platform provides an end-to-end grocer solution including
                    e-commerce (frontend), e-commerce management (backend),
                    intelligent Multiplex fulfillment and distribution system,
                    purchase order system, and more.

                <p>
                    Throughout my 8-months at Tulip, I had the opportunity to
                    work on so many features that I cannot possibly list all of
                    them. I made a total of <b>303</b> merge-requests (MRs,
                    equivalent to GitHub pull-requests or PRs); these
                    contributions consisted of small and large features across
                    10+ repositories. On average, this is 2 contributions
                    per-day; although, on some days I would contribute 30+
                    times. The tech-stack included PHP (CodeIgniter),
                    JavaScript, ExtJS, MySQL, Apache Solr, beanstalkd.
                    Additionally, I worked directly with business stakeholders
                    and external vendors allowing ideas to flow freely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below, I list some significant changes that benefitted me as
                    a developer, further expanding my skill set.

                <h3>Daily Standup</h3>
                <p>
                    On a daily cadence, our team would meet virtually at 10:00am
                    to hold a scrum/standup. Here, each team member would
                    discuss three points of information:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What we worked on the work-day prior</li>
                    <li>What we are going to work on today</li>
                    <li>What, if anything, is blocking our work?</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="center">
                    <img src="img/standup.jpeg" alt="" width="800" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    In order to organize my work and thoughts prior to our
                    standup, I used an app called
                    <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a>. In Notion, I
                    utilized the Kanban-style board feature. For each task, I
                    would create a card and sort it Trello-style with columns
                    such as Todo, Blocked, Working on, Ready for Deployment, and
                    Complete. This way, I can keep track of work that needs to
                    be done and work completed. If I get stuck on something, it
                    goes to the Blocked column. This proved to be largely
                    beneficial to my morning standup fluency and transparency. I
                    also added a flag on each card to indicate which project it
                    was related to.

                <h3>Well.ca French Localization</h3>
                <p>
                    During my time at Tulip, I have had the opportunity to work
                    on a plethora of interesting and challenging problems. One
                    highlight of my work term has been developing the French
                    localized website for one of our clients, Well.ca. Although
                    I wasn't the only developer at the wheel, I had a large role
                    in integrating an internationalization SaaS, Smartling,
                    which would eventually become the source of French content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Well.ca contains millions of translatable content, a
                    typical translation workflow would not be feasible. The fact
                    that the content on Well.ca updates at a high frequency
                    increased the complexity of this project. I utilized
                    Smartling's Machine Translation software to receive
                    on-the-fly translations as content is uploaded or modified.
                    Using event listeners coupled with a job dispatcher, I was
                    able to orchestrate the translation of thousands of strings
                    within a few minutes. To ingest the completed translations,
                    I had to develop a webhook that listens for a status update
                    from Smartling. This saved the Well.ca team thousands of
                    work hours and will continue to do so for the foreseeable
                    future.

                <h3>Well.ca Distribution Centre Visit</h3>
                <p>
                    Working at Tulip continuously heightened my passion for
                    exploring and learning about new tech. When I heard that my
                    manager was going on a trip to the Well.ca fulfillment and
                    distribution centre in Guelph, I was eager to join them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since my position is remote, I was also interested in
                    meeting the person I report to every day. I jokingly said,
                    “you should stop by and say hello!” This led to a generous
                    invitation to visit them at the warehouse. I was thrilled!
                    During my visit, I learned more about the physical
                    fulfillment process and the coordination behind the scenes.
                    I was able to see the code that I wrote being used by
                    hundreds of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having the power to make day-to-day operations easier or
                    more intuitive is a great feeling - seeing this in action
                    makes those feelings come to life. I am extremely grateful
                    to my team and Well.ca for allowing me to have the
                    opportunity.

                <h3>Tulip Grocery Partner - Marches TAU</h3>
                <p>
                    I also had the opportunity to work on the new grocery
                    e-commerce partnership with a grocer based in Quebec,
                    Marches TAU. I developed several major features, such as
                    their loyalty program (Paystone DataCandy) integration,
                    dynamic landing page improvements which improve SEO,
                    scheduled store flyer system using FlowPaper, physical
                    POS-to-website live inventory and order synchronization,
                    ease-of-use backend utilities for staff to upload content in
                    bulk, and <i>many</i> frontend UI mockup integrations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was an interesting project to work on as it was brand
                    new and the client is relatively small. This gave us as
                    developers more creative freedom to experiment with new
                    backlogged features. We also had loose deadlines as the site
                    has not been released, giving us more time to test and
                    validate.

                    work and work on something of their interest (bonus if the
                    project is eventually integrated into the eco-system).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my first Hackday (Q3), I teamed up with two other co-op
                    students from UofG and we visited the Arboretum. There, we
                    cleaned up lots of garbage and litter, totaling over 10
                    extra-large garbage bags. It was a great opportunity to meet
                    my colleagues when working remotely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On my second Hackday (Q4), I worked with someone from my
                    core team named Chris C. Me and Chris are both interested in
                    IoT devices, and share a common problem: washroom
                    availability. I came up with an idea to somehow monitor the
                    status of washrooms in our own home, while preserving
                    privacy. Think airplane lavatory. Chris decided that the
                    name should be "<a
                        href="https://github.com/ccarrster/WashroomWhistle"
                        >Washroom Whistle</a
                    >". We started with a WiFi-enabled magnetic door security
                    alarm. Using this, we interfaced with the Tuya (brand)
                    private API to wait for door status updates. We made a
                    Dockerized web-app composed of React for the frontend, and
                    NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB for the backend. The frontend
                    would poll our Node backend API in order to inform the user
                    of whether the washroom was free or not. Since we were
                    limited to 6-7 hours of development time, we weren't able to
                    complete every feature we had planned such as metrics, a
                    React Native app, web-sockets, etc.

                <h3>Ian Pavlinic Memorial Award for Innovation</h3>
                <p>
                    While not a workplace contribution, I feel that I should
                    mention my nomination for the Ian Pavlinic Memorial Award
                    for Innovation, Co-op Student of the Year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In November, my manager brought up a University of Guelph
                    Co-op award, the Ian Pavlinic Memorial Award. He generously
                    offered to nominate me, to which I had an easy answer.
                    Throughout the next 3 days, I spent many hours working on
                    and revising my personal statement. I worked alongside my
                    manager as he also had to write an employer statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently awaiting the results of the award. Winning
                    this award would be incredibly beneficial to my career by
                    possibly opening up many more job opportunities.

                <h3>Work Term 1 (S21) Learning Goals</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Personal Goal</b>: I would like to work on a
                        project/product with a modern tech-stack. I've had
                        previous experience working with legacy PHP code and
                        would like to devote some time during my term to
                        improving my knowledge of modern frontend and backend
                        frameworks.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: I was able to work on a
                                recently released Tulip product titled
                                Fulfillment. It used a modern version of the
                                CodeIgniter PHP framework. I was able to learn
                                more about this technology worked whether
                                frontend or backend.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Personal Goal</b>: I would like to learn more about
                        DevOps, including CI/CD. I've always been interested in
                        this subset of the industry and would enjoy the
                        opportunity to learn more about it. Learning more about
                        Kubernetes/horizontal-scaling as well as cloud
                        infrastructure would be a plus.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: The Tulip Fulfillment
                                product used modern CI/CD techniques utilizing
                                GitLab's Pipeline and Job features. I only
                                skimmed the surface, but was able to see how it
                                worked and how it would run tests on each MR
                                automatically.
                            </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Teamwork Goal</b>: I would like to get better at
                        context-switching within a team. Some tasks require
                        collaborative group-effort, and others require only
                        individual work. Switching between these types of tasks
                        is difficult as you cannot rely on your teammates when
                        working individually.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: I felt like I massively
                                improved this skill during this term. Since I
                                was working on two major projects (and being
                                pulled between the two), I was forced to respond
                                to whatever was more urgent. This required
                                completely switching my local working
                                environment. I also had to learn to pause any
                                on-going work if I were to switch. I utilized
                                the "git stash" feature heavily.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h3>Work Term 2 (F21) Learning Goals</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Personal Goal</b>: I would like to help new employees
                        on the team onboard with our development toolset by the
                        end of my work-term. I believe this will help me better
                        understand the setup process and ways to improve it.
                        Doing so will also benefit my communication and
                        leadership skills
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: While I wasn't directly
                                assigned to on-board a new employee, I certainly
                                helped on multiple occasions. Specifically, when
                                a new employee was stuck on an issue that I had
                                encountered in the past, I would offer my help
                                and conduct a video conference to troubleshoot
                                and fix the problem.

                    <li>
                        <b>Personal Goal</b>: By the end of my work-term, I
                        would like to learn enough about CI/CD such that I can
                        be a support in using this solution for the release of a
                        project. Our most likely project to launch (before the
                        end of my term) is a good candidate.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: I wasn't able to action
                                this goal as the mentioned project did not
                                launch on time. It is set to launch early
                                January and I am excited to see all of my work
                                live!

                        <b>Personal Goal</b>: I would love to participate in the
                        company Hackday (in December) and build or experiment
                        with a new (to me) technology. It would be a bonus if my
                        project idea contributed to a real feature in the Tulip

                    <u>Conclusion</u>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All-in-all, these two work terms completely blew my
                    expectations. Considering it was my first co-op experience,
                    I was nervous and rudely struck by imposter-syndrome. The
                    Tulip team welcomed me with open arms, even stopping their
                    work to help me when I was stuck. I felt just as much a part
                    of the team as my full-time co-workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering I was well-versed in the Tulip tech stack prior
                    to joining, I was worried whether or not I would benefit
                    technically from this position - I was very wrong. Working
                    with such a large codebase serving millions of people daily
                    humbled my pre-formed expectations entirely.

                    I would like to thank my managers, Dawid and Eugene for
                    allowing me the opportunity and mentoring me throughout my
                    time at Tulip. They have set the bar so high that I am
                    curious to know what my future work experience will offer.
                    Additionally, the help and support from every person on my
                    team was immensely constructive to my technical skills and
                    soft skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would also like to thank Kate McRoberts and Laura Gatto
                    for the amazing support over the last 8 months. Whenever I
                    had a question, they would respond ridiculously fast (2
                    minutes fast), even when it would not be convenient for
                    them. When I was worried about whether or not to go with
                    Tulip, Laura guided me and I am now certain I made the right
                    decision. They are both truly awesome.
