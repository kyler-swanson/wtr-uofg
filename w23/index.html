                    <u>Introduction</u>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From January 2023 to August 2023, I had the opportunity to
                    work at <a href="https://d2l.com">D2L</a>!
                    Specifically, I worked on a subsidiary of the Foundation 
                    team, called team "Squidward". Throughout these 8 months, 
                    I learned a lot about software engineering, including low level
                    development that effects all other developers at the company. 
                    This position was remote, so I had the opportunity to work from home. Our team 
                    hosted a few events at the downtown Toronto office, where I had the opportunity 
                    to meet the rest of the team!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to return to Tulip after working 8 months in 2021.
                    I'm glad I did as I learned a lot and accomplished more than I 
                    had imagined. I worked on many features; these
                    contributions consisted of small and large features across
                    10+ repositories. The tech-stack included PHP (CodeIgniter),
                    JavaScript, ExtJS, MySQL, Apache Solr, beanstalkd.
                    Additionally, I worked directly with business stakeholders
                    and external vendors allowing ideas to flow freely; this was
                    particularly important when I was working on the PayPal
                    integration project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below, I list some significant changes that benefitted me as
                    a developer, further expanding my skill set.
                </p>
                <section id="standup"></section>
                <h3>Daily Standup</h3>
                <p>
                    On a daily cadence, our team would meet virtually at 10:00am
                    to hold a scrum/standup. Here, each team member would
                    discuss three points of information:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What we worked on the work-day prior</li>
                    <li>What we are going to work on today</li>
                    <li>What, if anything, is blocking our work?</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="center">
                    <img src="img/standup.jpeg" alt="" width="800" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    In order to organize my work and thoughts prior to our
                    standup, I used an app called
                    <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a>. In Notion, I
                    utilized the Kanban-style board feature. For each task, I
                    would create a card and sort it Trello-style with columns
                    such as To-do, Blocked, Working on, Ready for Deployment, and
                    Complete. This way, I can keep track of work that needs to
                    be done and work completed. If I get stuck on something, it
                    goes to the Blocked column. This proved to be largely
                    beneficial to my morning standup fluency and transparency. I
                    also added a flag on each card to indicate which project it
                    was related to.

                <h3>PayPal Integration Project</h3>
                <p>
                    During my time at Tulip, I have had the opportunity to work
                    on a plethora of interesting and challenging problems. One
                    highlight of my work term has been the PayPal integration project.
                    This project involved integrating PayPal into Well.ca's checkout flow.
                    The project was a large undertaking, and I was able to work on it from start to finish.
                    I worked with the business stakeholders to understand the requirements and 
                    then worked with the external vendor to implement the integration. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Well.ca receives thousands of orders per day, it was important to ensure that the
                    integration was robust and reliable. I worked with the business stakeholders to ensure that
                    the integration was tested thoroughly. I also worked with the external vendor to ensure that
                    the integration was verified on their end.
                </p>

                <h3>Vagrant-to-Docker Conversion</h3>
                <p>
                    When me and the other co-op students received our Tulip equipment,
                    we realized that they are the new M1 Macs. This meant that we could not
                    use Vagrant to run our development environment as it utilized VirtualBox. 
                    VirtualBox is not supported on M1 machines and therefore, we had to find a new solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with the other co-op students to convert our Vagrant environment to Docker.
                    This was a large undertaking as I had to split up the monolithic single virtual machine
                    into a multi-container environment. I also had to ensure that the environment was 
                    compatible with the version of PHP that Well.ca is using. This proved to be a challenge
                    as the PHP version was quite old. It was difficult to find a PHP Docker image that would
                    work with the M1 architecture
                </p>
                <p>
                    This opportunity also allowed me to write meaningful documentation that would help future
                    employees. I wrote a guide on how to set up the development environment and how to use it.
                    This documentation was written in Markdown and hosted on Atlassian Confluence.

                <h3>Gift Boxes</h3>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I worked on a customer facing feature that allowed customers to
                    purchase gift boxes. From the customer's point of view, they are purchasing
                    a preset gift box that contains a variety of products. From the fulfillment
                    and business point of view, they are selling multiple products that is wrapped
                    in a gift box. This was a challenging feature to work on as it involved
                    a lot of business logic and required a lot of testing.

                        getting a legacy codebase up-and-running on new M1/Apple Silicon-based 
                        machines in a Docker environment. To make this process accessible 
                        (once I leave), I will need to write documentation highlighting this process.
                        Doing this will improve my technical writing skills. I will be able to 
                        measure my success based on the feedback received on the piece I will write.

                                I was able to port the monolithic development environment (running
                                on a single Vagrant-based virtual machine) to a multi-container 
                                Docker environment. I was able to write detailed documentation 
                                highlighting the process. I received positive feedback from my
                                manager and the team. I was able to use this documentation to
                                help onboard two other co-op students.

                        knowledge of modern frontend and backend frameworks. I plan on getting 
                        involved in a project within the company that uses a modern tech stack 
                        by working with my manager to decide on tasks or tickets that need to 
                        be completed.

                                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: Unfortunately, I was not able to work on a
                                project that used a modern tech stack. The client needs of the main 
                                project our team focuses on took priority.

                        <b>Teamwork Goal</b>: It would be a great opportunity to be able to 
                        plan and implement a large feature from start to finish. With talks of 
                        PayPal being re-implemented on Well.ca, I may have the opportunity to 
                        scope the project by breaking it into meaningful pieces, plan my 
                        implementation, and additionally learn a lot regarding the checkout and 
                        payment flow. Achieving this will give me a higher level understanding 
                        of system design that is core to any e-commerce platform

                                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: This goal was a success as I was able to work
                                and complete the PayPal integration. I started by working with the business 
                                stakeholders to understand the requirements and then started scoping the 
                                project. I then worked with the external vendor to ensure that the integration
                                was working as expected.

                    All-in-all, this work term was a great learning experience. I was able to
                    work on a large project that had a large impact on the company. I was able
                    to work with a team of talented individuals and learn a lot from them. The
                    Tulip team welcomed me back with open arms. I felt just as much a part
                    of the team as my full-time co-workers. Considering I was well-versed in the 
                    Tulip product prior to joining, I was able to hit the ground running. I was 
                    able to contribute to the team from day one.

                    I would like to thank my managers, Dawid and Eugene for
                    allowing me back and mentoring me throughout my
                    time at Tulip. They continue to set the bar so high that I am
                    curious to know what my future work experience will offer.
                    Additionally, the help and support from every person on my
                    team was immensely constructive to my technical skills and
                    soft skills.
