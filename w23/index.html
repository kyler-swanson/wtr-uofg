          <u>Introduction</u>
        </h2>
        <p>
          From January 2023 to August 2023, I had the opportunity to work at <a href="https://d2l.com">D2L</a>!
          Specifically, I worked on a subsidiary of the Foundation team, called team "Squidward". Throughout these 8
          months, I learned a lot about software engineering, including low level development that effects all other
          developers at the company. This position was remote, so I had the opportunity to work from home. Our team
          hosted a few events at the downtown Toronto office, where I had the opportunity to meet the rest of the team!
        </p>

        <h2>
          <u>Job Description</u>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Team Squidward worked on core APIs that lay the foundation of Brightspace. These APIs are used by all other
          teams at D2L. We worked primarily in C# using a slightly modified version of .NET Framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I joined D2L in January, the team's focus (and focus for the last few years) was migrating the version of
          .NET to a newer, more modern version, as well as improving the codebase overall. This was a large undertaking
          as the codebase is quite large and has been around for many years. There are also many instances of unsafe
          code, which cannot be directly migrated. This means that the code must be rewritten in a safe way. This is a
          large undertaking as it requires a lot of planning and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          A large focus during my first 4 months was strategizing this migration. An integral component is the YARP
          proxy. The proxy will allow D2L developers to support and develop the to-be legacy codebase, while being able
          to incrementally move functionality to the new platform.
        </p>
        <p>Below, I list some significant changes that benefitted me as a developer, further expanding my skill set.</p>
        <section id="proxy"></section>
        <h3>Proxy Latency Investigation</h3>
        <p>
          When we were deciding if using the YARP proxy would be a good choice, we needed some concrete figures to weigh
          against other options. I was able to subtly simulate load on an Brightspace instance behind a proxy by
          configuring a basic JMeter stress test. The traces produced by the test were aggregated and summarized to
          compare the overall latency incurred from adding the YARP proxy. After working on these numbers, I shifted
          towards focusing on a more permanent solution allowing us to keep track of the overhead in real-time!

        </div>
        <section id="otel"></section>
        <h3>OpenTelemetry Instrumentation</h3>
        <p>
          I added the OpenTelemetry .NET library to the new proxy server, which allows us to easily collect various
          telemetry, including tracing, metrics, and logging. To hit the ground running, we decided to export process
          level measurements within proxy server. These metrics are pushed to AWS Timestream via Telegraf. I also wrote
          a custom exporter within OpenTelemetry, allowing us to push these metrics to Telegraf.
        </p>

        <br />
        <section id="pinned"></section>
        <h3>Pinned Attribute</h3>
        <p>
          Due to a defect related to dangerous serialization that was discovered when extracting libraries, we had to be
          careful about which types we moved over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since serialized data contains indispensable type information, we couldn't just move everything we came
          across. Some types can't be moved at all!
        </p>
        <p>
          I created a "Pinned" attribute, which includes a Roslyn analyzer, forcing pinned types to stay where they are.
        </p>

        <section id="dal"></section>
        <h3>Eliminating dynamic assembly loading</h3>
        <h4>What is it?</h4>
        <p>
          Dynamic assembly loading or DAL is the process of loading external assemblies (and the types within them) into
          the current application domain. Allows the developer access to types that are otherwise inaccessible within
          the current domain.
        </p>
        <h4>The problem</h4>
        <p>
          While DAL is incredibly powerful to the developer, it comes with some trade-offs that threaten the possibility
          of migration to modern .NET.
        </p>
        <p>DAL is heavily relied upon for de/serialization.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Serialized data contains critical type info required to deserialize it.</li>
          <li>Serialized data can persist for a significant amount of time (in the DB)</li>
          <li>
            If a type were to move (for example, in the <b>process of a migration</b>), the runtime will fail to
            deserialize the data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>DAL in Assigned Activities</h4>
        <p>
          While there were a handful of DAL eliminating initiatives that I worked on this summer, Assigned Activities
          was a significant hurdle and milestone for myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assigned Activities publishes a handful of tasks to Amazon SQS, which are queued to be handled asynchronously
          at a later time.
        </p>
        <p>
          When ready to process the task, we deserialize the data from SQS. This contains type name information which is
          parsed with <code>Type.GetType()</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided to assign each task a unique GUID which will identify the type instead. If one of these tasks were
          to move location, now the SQS processor would still be able to locate the type. This had to be released
          incrementally, due to blue-green deployment rules!
        </p>

          <u>Goals and Outcomes</u>
        </h2>
        <h3>Work Term Learning Goals</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Technological Literacy Goal</b>: I want to learn about modern .NET Core and the intricacies of planning
            migrations and migrating legacy code (particularly by working on this directly). I plan on achieving this by
            working with my manager to find a project that will allow me to work with modern .NET Core and by
            contributing to the migration of the legacy codebase.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: Overall, I was able to achieve this goal. I was able to work with modern .NET
                Core and contribute to the migration of the legacy codebase. I was able to work on a project that
                involved migrating legacy code to modern .NET Core. I was able to work with my manager to find a project
                (YARP proxy) that would allow me to work with modern .NET Core!
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Technological Literacy Goal</b>: I want to learn more about SQL Server and the differences between that
            and alternatives (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: There was not much opportunity to work with SQL Server. Our team's focus was
                more about the core APIs, which did not necessarily interact with the database (higher level).
                Therefore, I would not say that I achieved this goal.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Personal Goal</b>: I want to learn more about CI/CD particularly in the realm of dev/QA/production
            deployments (including feature flags, db migrations, rollbacks, etc.) specifically involving our team and
            how a large-scale migration to .NET Core might affect this.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: This goal was a success! I learned and implemented a feature flag for a new
                feature. I also learned a lot about blue/green deployment methodology which is used at D2L.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Problem Solving Goal</b>: I want to learn more about planning and coordinating medium/large scale
            projects at a lower level (ie. taking the lead).
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Goal Reflection</b>: I was able to achieve this goal. I was able to take the lead on implementing an
                observability solution for the YARP proxy. I was able to work with my manager to plan and coordinate
                this project.
              </li>
